	<p><img src="../Basic-Portfolio/assets/images/FullSizeRender.jpg" align ="left" alt="SapanaRaut" height="150" width="150">I am Sapana Raut: SharePoint Analyst. I worked as an SharePoint Analyst for almost five years. I started to grow so much interest on being developer while in work. One fine morning, I decided to quit job and start al over again to learn new technology. As I was doing research, I was keen on the full time course UT Austin has to offer. I am so looking forward for the new beginning.</p>
	<p>I believe persistence,listening to those who matter, turning out who don't and creating on a consistent basis are the key factors for a successful life.I have one beautiful two and half year old son. I love travelling, hiking, food and adventures.Life has been good to me and I am thankful for everything I have.
